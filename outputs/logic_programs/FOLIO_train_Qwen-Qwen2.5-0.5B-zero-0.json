Daniel is a citizen of Lawton Park.\nThe statement \"Daniel is a citizen of Lawton Park\" is uncertain. The information provided does not specify whether Daniel is a citizen of Lawton Park or not. It is possible that Daniel is a citizen of Lawton Park, but it is also possible that he is not.

Stonefish is a fish. It stings to step on a stonefish. Stonefish stings cause death if not treated. To treat stonefish stings, apply heat to the affected area or use an antivenom. Stonefish stings can cause death if not treated.\nConclusion:\nStings of some fish can cause death if not treated.\nThe statement \"Stings of some fish can cause death if not treated\" is true. According to the information provided, some fish may stings, and if not treated, it can cause death. However, the statement does not specify the type of fish or the specific type of stings, so it is not possible to determine if the statement is true or false based on the given information. It is important to note that the statement is based on the assumption that the type of fish and the type of stings are known, and it is not possible to determine the exact cause of death based on the given information. Therefore, the statement is true based on the information provided. However, it is important to note that the statement is not a definitive statement and should be interpreted with caution. It is recommended to consult with a medical professional for a more accurate and definitive answer. \n\nThe problem description and question are already in first-order logic formulars.

The information provided does not explicitly state that Miss Americana is not directed by a filmmaker from Kirkland. However, it is possible that Miss Americana is directed by a filmmaker from Kirkland, but the information given does not provide enough evidence to confirm or deny this. Therefore, the statement is uncertain. \n\nTo determine the truth value of the statement, additional information or context would be needed. For example, if Miss Americana is indeed directed by a filmmaker from Kirkland, then the statement would be true. If Miss Americana is not directed by a filmmaker from Kirkland, then the statement would be false. Without more information, we cannot definitively say whether the statement is true or false. \n\nIn summary, the statement \"Miss Americana is not directed by a filmmaker from Kirkland\" is uncertain based on the given information.

Sally does not work for a company that uses the US GAAP.\nThe statement \"Sally does not work for a company that uses the US GAAP\" is uncertain. The information provided does not explicitly state that Sally works for a company that uses the US GAAP. It only states that Sally works for the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which is a company that uses the US GAAP. Therefore, the statement is uncertain. However, if we assume that Sally works for a company that uses the US GAAP, then the statement would be true.

This means that Fido could be either a Bengal tiger or a cat. Since Bengal tigers are not cats, Fido cannot be a Bengal tiger. Therefore, Fido cannot be a husky, as huskies are not cats. Hence, the statement \"Fido is not a husky\" is true. \n\nHowever, it is important to note that the premise \"Fido is either a Bengal tiger or a cat\" does not provide any information about the relationship between Bengal tigers and cats. It only states that Fido could be either a Bengal tiger or a cat, but it does not provide any information about the relationship between Bengal tigers and cats. Therefore, the statement \"Fido is not a husky\" is not necessarily true based on the given information. \n\nIn conclusion, the statement \"Fido is not a husky\" is true based on the given information, but it is not necessarily true based on the premise \"Fido is either a Bengal tiger or a cat\". The relationship between Bengal tigers and cats is not explicitly stated in the given information. \n\nHowever, if we assume that Bengal tigers are not cats, then the statement \"Fido is not a husky\" would be true. In this case, Fido could be either a Bengal tiger or a cat, and the statement would be true. \n\nIn conclusion, the statement \"Fido is not a husky\" is true based on the given information, but it is not necessarily true based on the premise \"Fido is either a Bengal tiger or a cat\". The relationship between Bengal tigers and cats is not explicitly stated in the given information. \n\nIf we assume that Bengal tigers are not cats, then the statement \"Fido is not a husky\" would be true.

The premise states that Imagine Dragons is a rock band, and Dan is a lead singer of this band. Since Dan is also a songwriter, it follows that some rock band has a songwriter. The other information provided in the premise, such as Dan being a lead singer and being a songwriter, supports this conclusion. Additionally, the information about Demons being one of the most popular singles of Imagine Dragons and some of its songs being on Billboard Hot 100 further supports the idea that some rock band has a songwriter. Therefore, the statement is true based on the given information. However, it's important to note that the statement is not necessarily true for all rock bands, as there could be other rock bands that do not have a songwriter.
