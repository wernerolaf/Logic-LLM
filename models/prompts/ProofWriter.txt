Given a problem description and a question. The task is to parse the problem and the question into first-order logic formulars.
The grammar of the first-order logic formular is defined as follows:
1) logical conjunction of expr1 and expr2: expr1 ∧ expr2
2) logical disjunction of expr1 and expr2: expr1 ∨ expr2
3) logical exclusive disjunction of expr1 and expr2: expr1 ⊕ expr2
4) logical negation of expr1: ¬expr1
5) expr1 implies expr2: expr1 → expr2
6) expr1 if and only if expr2: expr1 ↔ expr2
7) logical universal quantification: ∀x
8) logical existential quantification: ∃x

Problem:
Anne is quiet. Erin is furry. Erin is green. Fiona is furry. Fiona is quiet. Fiona is red. Fiona is rough. Fiona is white. Harry is furry. Harry is quiet. Harry is white. Young people are furry. If Anne is quiet then Anne is red. Young, green people are rough. If someone is green then they are white. If someone is furry and quiet then they are white. If someone is young and white then they are rough. All red people are young.
Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or unknown? Anne is white.
###
Predicates:
Quiet(x) ::: x is quiet
Furry(x) ::: x is furry
Green(x) ::: x is green
Red(x) ::: x is red
Rough(x) ::: x is rough
White(x) ::: x is white
Young(x) ::: x is young
Premises:
Quiet(anne)
Furry(erin) ∧ Green(erin)
Furry(fiona) ∧ Quiet(fiona) ∧ Red(fiona) ∧ Rough(fiona) ∧ White(fiona)
Furry(harry) ∧ Quiet(harry) ∧ White(harry)
∀x (Young(x) → Furry(x))
Quiet(anne) → Red(anne)
∀x ((Young(x) ∧ Green(x)) → Rough(x))
∀x (Green(x) → White(x))
∀x ((Furry(x) ∧ Quiet(x)) → White(x))
∀x ((Young(x) ∧ White(x)) → Rough(x))
∀x (Red(x) → Young(x))
Conclusion:
White(anne) ::: Anne is white.
